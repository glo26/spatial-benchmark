# PDF Review Findings

## Current Status

### Positive
1. All text is now BLACK (no blue hyperlinks visible in citations or URLs)
2. Table 1 (Ablation Study) renders correctly on page 5
3. Mathematical formulas (Equations 1-5) render correctly on page 4
4. References section starts on page 5 with 53+ citations visible
5. Your spatial survey paper is cited as reference [12]: "Gloria Felicia et al. From perception to action: Spatial ai agents and world models. arXiv preprint arXiv:2602.01644, 2026."

### Issues to Fix
1. **Figures are on separate pages at the end** (pages 9-10) instead of inline with text
2. **Float too large warning** - Figure 1 is too large for the page
3. Paper is 10 pages but figures should be inline, not at the end

### Next Steps
1. Fix figure placement to be inline with text (use [h] or [ht] placement)
2. Reduce figure width to fit properly
3. Ensure figures appear near their first reference
