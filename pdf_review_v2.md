# PDF Review v2 - Key Findings

## Status: SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED

### Positive
1. **All text is BLACK** - No blue hyperlinks visible
2. **Figure 1 (Framework)** - Now inline on page 2, properly sized
3. **Figure 2 (Task Distribution)** - Now inline on page 4, properly sized
4. **Paper is now 8 pages** - Much more compact and professional
5. **Mathematical formulas** - Equations 1-5 render correctly on page 4
6. **Citations** - 53+ references visible in bibliography

### Paper Structure
- Page 1: Title, Abstract, Introduction
- Page 2: Introduction cont., Figure 1, Related Work
- Page 3: The SpatialOps Benchmark (Design Principles, Task Taxonomy)
- Page 4: Figure 2, Dataset Composition, Evaluation Metrics (5 formulas)
- Page 5-7: References
- Page 8: Appendix (if any)

### Remaining Issues
- Need to verify 200+ references are actually cited in the text
- Need stronger narrative throughout
- May need to expand content for full NeurIPS submission

### Next Steps
- Push to GitHub
- Verify reference count
