# SpatialEval Name Conflict Research

## CRITICAL FINDING: Name Already Taken

There is an **existing benchmark named "SpatialEval"** published at NeurIPS 2024:

- **Paper**: "Is A Picture Worth A Thousand Words? Delving Into Spatial Reasoning for Vision-Language Models"
- **Authors**: J Wang et al. (2024)
- **Citations**: 151+
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/jiayuww/SpatialEval
- **Website**: https://spatialeval.github.io/
- **Focus**: VLM spatial reasoning (relationship understanding, navigation, counting)

## Recommendation

We MUST rename our benchmark to avoid confusion and potential rejection. Suggested alternatives:

1. **SpatialPlan** - Emphasizes 2D spatial planning focus
2. **PlanEval** - Focus on planning evaluation
3. **Spatial2D** - Emphasizes 2D focus
4. **GeoSpatialEval** - Emphasizes geospatial/real-world focus
5. **SpatialPlanBench** - Combines planning and benchmark
6. **AtlasBench** - Ties to AtlasPro use cases
7. **PlanSpatial** - Planning-first naming

## Key Differentiators from Existing SpatialEval

Our benchmark differs in:
1. Focus on **2D spatial PLANNING** (not just reasoning)
2. **Text-only** evaluation (not vision-language)
3. **Algorithmic tasks** (A*, pathfinding, optimization)
4. **Industry use cases** (real estate, network infrastructure)
5. **12 categories** vs their 4 dimensions
